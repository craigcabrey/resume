This repository contains the LaTeX source code for my resume. In order to build
it, you must have a standard installation of LaTeX available in your `PATH`.

For example, on Arch Linux systems, install the `texcore-core` package and that
will be good enough.

To build the resume, `cd` into the root of the repository and run `make`.

A prebuilt copy of my resume can be found on my site,
[craigcabrey.github.io](https://craigcabrey.github.io).
